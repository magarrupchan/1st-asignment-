            <h2>My experience</h2>
            <p>During the module, I focused on understanding the basics of HTML, CSS . One of the most challenging yet rewarding experiences was mastering the debugging process. For example, fixing responsiveness issues taught me the importance of testing across different devices.</p>
            <p>Design-wise, I chose the "Poppins" font for its sleek, modern look and paired it with a black background and cyan accents (#09C0EE) to make the content visually striking. motive for choosing the icons for github, facebook,twiter came from  sites like <a href="https://fontawesome.com/search?q=tiktok&o=r" target="_blank">Google fonts</a>.</p>
